  "summary": "COREII Modeling and Simulation Team conducted a test on the Standard Natural Gas Compressor Station Model. The team included researchers from SNL and INL. The primary goal of the test was to leverage MITRE Caldera Adversary Emulation against a compressor station safety control system to cause a loss of safety and unsafe activities.",
