            "description": "The Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) is issuing this lab call to solicit proposals for the Energy I-Corps (EIC) program. The goal of EIC is to train researchers at DOE National Laboratories, and DOE plants, and sites to identify market pathways for their technology. This call solicits proposals from DOE National Laboratory, plant, and site technology transfer offices to participate in EIC, for researchers to develop skills in commercialization, and to investigate the market potential for DOE-funded technologies at a critical juncture on the path toward commercialization. OTT expects to award up to $500K across Topics 1 and 3 in this instance of the EIC lab call, depending on FY25 appropriations. However, additional funding may be available based on proposals' alignment with DOE program office goals. Individual DOE program offices and partner agencies, including OTT, will review and assess relevant applications for possible selection and funding. DOE expects to select EIC projects in the following three topics: Topic 1: EIC Pipeline Development - This topic seeks proposals for projects and programming that have the potential to directly increase participation in EIC Training Cohorts (Topic 2) in future EIC lab calls. Deadline - Friday, April 11, 2025 at 3:00 p.m. (ET) Topic 2: EIC Training Cohort (Cohort 21) - This topic seeks team applications to participate in EIC Cohort 21. Selected teams of researchers will participate in an intensive two-month, curriculum-based program to learn the principles of the business model canvas, define value proposition, and identify customer segments. Teams will develop hypotheses on these elements and interview at least 75 stakeholders as part of the customer discovery process to iterate on their business model canvas and to better understand the market’s adoption readiness of the lab technology. Application *only for Topic 2* via MS Forms. Nothing needs to be submitted to EERE Exchange. Link: https://forms.office.com/g/SL4qKLhnmq Deadline - Friday, April 11, 2025 at 3:00 p.m. (ET) Topic 3: Post EIC - This Topic is an opportunity to continue advancing EIC Topic 2 technologies toward commercialization. The technology must 1) be from a DOE Laboratory or DOE plant or site AND 2) have gone through either EIC Training Cohort (Topic 2) or the U.S. National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps. EIC Training Cohort graduates and non-graduates can apply to this topic. However, non-graduates are limited to individuals who are employed by or have a contractual relationship with a DOE National Lab, DOE plant or site (e.g. Technology Transfer Office personnel). Deadline - Friday, April 11, 2025 at 3:00 p.m. (ET)",

            "description": "The Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO) supports the development of a globally competitive U.S. energy industrial base that drives supply chain resiliency and energy security through materials and manufacturing innovation. The development of circular supply chains that enable efficient use of materials through reuse, repair, remanufacture, and recycling is important toward accomplishing these goals. Efforts to achieve a robust and competitive manufacturing sector through innovation in circular supply chains cannot be successful without: (1) a comprehensive understanding of the landscape of technical and non-technical factors that could impact the adoption of emerging technologies and (2) strong connections across the circularity field to accelerate innovations from R&D-scale to commercial practice. This NOFO seeks to establish a new accelerator which will address this need through the development of a comprehensive technical and market analysis portfolio and stakeholder engagement activities. The Accelerator’s analysis portfolio will establish a comprehensive understanding of both technical and non-technical factors impacting the adoption of emerging technologies for circular supply chains. Technical factors of interest include the state of emerging technologies in terms of performance and cost metrics. Awareness of these technical factors requires strong understanding of the R&D landscape as well as the state of industrial practice. Non-technical factors of interest include market conditions, supply chain dynamics, policy and regulatory landscape, workforce readiness, infrastructure capabilities, among others. These non-technical market factors may be region-specific and would be critical to inform a systems-level perspective of potential barriers and pathways to widespread commercial adoption. The Accelerator will leverage understanding of technical and non-technical factors to analyze market opportunity within specific product and material market segments. This will identify specific early adopter markets and sequential pathways to more broadly scale the deployment of emerging technologies for greater impact. Opportunities to leverage advancements in emerging technologies and market tools (e.g., standards, offtake agreements, verification frameworks, data systems, etc.) across product and material segments will also be identified. The Accelerator’s stakeholder engagement activities will cultivate a range of stakeholders that are critical to both supporting the analysis portfolio and to facilitating the coordination needed for technology adoption for circular supply chains. These stakeholder engagement activities will strengthen relationships with industry members to support increased sharing of data and best practices as there are many synergistic technology needs across different product and material segments. These programs will enable enhanced diffusion of advancements in emerging technologies, business models and market tools throughout the circularity field. Most importantly, these stakeholder engagement activities will establish and cultivate relationships between potential performer groups that will strengthen the innovation ecosystem needed to deliver on other funded programs focused on building circular supply chain technologies.

Specifically, projects funded through this NOFO will encourage innovations in solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing across the supply chain, with the aim of reducing U.S. reliance on imported materials and technologies. This NOFO also encourages the development of new solar hardware and technology for domestic use and potential export. These activities are expected to deliver jobs and economic growth in the clean energy sector, while increasing national energy security. Topic Area 1 seeks to conduct early-stage pilot-scale testing and demonstration of innovative processes or products that can substantively increase domestic manufacturing in all segments of the crystalline silicon solar module supply chain. Each segment also includes the manufacturing equipment used in that segment, input materials for that segment, process control and characterization tools, and consumables used in that segment, which today are predominantly made outside the United States. Topic Area 2 aims to support the cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV industry, an increasingly valuable part of the U.S. economy and leading domestic renewable energy technology. All segments of the CdTe PV module supply chain are of interest, including improvements in materials, processes, manufacturing, components, metrology, demonstration, recycling, and reclamation. Topic Area 3 is focused on R&D and demonstration activities with the goal of de-risking new non-module PV components and manufacturing processes, while developing and validating a realistic pathway to commercial success. This includes structural and electrical components and tools that can be made domestically and improve performance, functionality, reliability, or ease of installation for PV systems.",

            "description": "An Action Plan for Maritime Energy and Emissions Innovation (Action Plan) calls for the Federal government to define Sustainable Maritime Fuel (SMF) in 2025. As described in the Action Plan, the maritime industry cannot rely solely on drop-in fuel replacements, so vessels must look towards alternative energy sources such as clean methanol, ammonia, hydrogen, electrification, and efficiency improvements as the industry moves towards zero- and near zero-emission fuels.  This action is key to evaluating many subsequent goals in the plan pertaining to future production volumes of SMFs. It will also help to align community, industry, government, financiers, and other maritime stakeholders regarding what qualifies as a SMF. This alignment will help to advance technology and investment with a consistent understanding of future maritime fuels. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks to engage industry, government, and maritime stakeholders for feedback on how to define “Sustainable Maritime Fuel.” While this RFI is being published by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), DOE is also working with other agencies to support the development of an SMF definition; these agencies include but are not limited to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of State, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This collaborative effort seeks feedback on a variety of aspects that may affect the eventual SMF definition, including but not necessarily limited to: minimum carbon intensity reductions, sustainability factors, criteria air pollutant inclusion (e.g. NOx, SOx, and particulate matter), acceptable feedstocks, how to align with global requirements (e.g. International Maritime Organization (IMO) and FuelEU), and whether accounting for emission reduction technologies (such as onboard carbon capture) should be included. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to DefiningSMF@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on February 28, 2025. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) attachment to the email, and no more than 3 pages in length, 12 point font, 1 inch margins. Only electronic responses will be accepted. This is solely a request for information and not a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO). EERE is not accepting applications. Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below.",

            "description": "This lab call represents the combined effort of fifteen different U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) programs and the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT). This solicitation offers an opportunity for external parties to partner with DOE’s National Labs to advance energy-related National Lab-developed technology toward commercialization and to reduce the barriers to commercializing lab-developed energy-related technologies and IP. The intent is to increase the volume and speed to which energy-related lab-developed technologies are integrated into the market from an improved lab commercialization ecosystem. For Fiscal Year 2025 (FY25), DOE continues to implement the previous year’s (FY24) approach for TCF Base Annual Appropriations addressing persistent barriers, bridging known gaps that deter the commercialization of laboratory technologies, and identifying where improvements are still needed. The intent of the Commercialization Enabling Topics (Topics 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of this lab call) is to fill in missing infrastructure pieces and strengthen existing components by addressing core commercialization challenges, barriers, and gaps, as well as their root causes (inside and outside of the labs). Additionally, the lab call will seek proposals from DOE’s National Labs to advance the commercialization of individual energy-related technologies (Topic 4), including supplemental project proposals for the Lab Embedded Entrepreneurship Program (LEEP).

Adjusted all proceeding dates, such as Reply to Reviewer Comments, by an equal amount of time. Adjusted award notification dates for Research, Technology, and Economic Security review.• Updated Table 3 to align the Allowable Fuel Types with Table 1. Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DE-FOA-0003371 FY24 Scale-up of Integrated Biorefineries supports higher risk bioenergy technologies that are ready to scale, ultimately demonstrating feedstock-conversion variations, or production pathways, to support commercialization and meet the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge goal of 35 billion gallons per year of SAF production by 2050 and the Clean Fuels and Products Shot goal of 50% projected demand for maritime, rail, off-road, and renewable carbon-based chemicals by 2050. The activities to be funded under this FOA will support the advancement of cost-shared research, development, and demonstration projects with partners in industry, academia, and the National Laboratories focused on the design, construction, operation, and validation of new technology and feedstock pathways for engineering scale integrated biorefineries.  The intent of this FOA is to reduce technology uncertainty and risk through cost-shared pilot- and demonstration-scale biorefinery projects. The FOA would support BETO’s multi-year strategic goals to 1) decarbonize the transportation sector through the production of cost-effective SAF and other strategic fuels, and 2) decarbonize the industrial sector through cost-effective and sustainable chemicals, materials, and processes utilizing biomass and waste resources. Topic Area 1 will identify, evaluate, and select applications proposing project definition, development, and execution plans for the scaling of pre-pilot (TRL 5) biofuel technologies to pilot scale (TRL 6). Topic Area 2 will identify, evaluate, and select applications proposing project definition, development, and execution plans for the scaling of pilot (TRL 6) biofuel technologies to demonstration scale (TRL 7-8). Topic Area 3 supports scale-up activities to produce organic chemicals from renewable biomass and waste feedstocks that can replace those currently derived from petroleum. Topic Area 3 will identify, evaluate, and select applications proposing project definition, development, and execution plans for the scaling of pre-pilot and pilot (TRL 5-6) biochemical technologies to pilot and demonstration scale (TRL 6-8). Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to FY24BETOScale-Up@ee.doe.gov See the full Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) in the DOCUMENTS section below. The required Concept Paper due date for this FOA is 11/07/2024 at 5PM ET. The Full Application due date for this FOA is 01/31/2025 at 5PM ET. The eXCHANGE system is currently designed to enforce hard deadlines for Concept Paper and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the FOA Deadline: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@ee.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues. Applicants that experience issues with submissions that result in a late submission: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission that results in a late submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@ee.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues (including finalizing the submission on behalf of, and with the Applicant's concurrence). DOE will only accept late applications when the Applicant has a) encountered technical difficulties beyond their control; b) has contacted the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance; and c) has submitted the application through eXCHANGE within 24 hours of the FOA's posted deadline.",

            "description": "Modification 0001: The purpose of this modification is to: • Update title for Topic 3 The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO), a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) entitled “Advanced Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies to Drive National Decarbonization.” Clean hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are important elements of a comprehensive energy portfolio, particularly for use in hard-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy (such as heavy-duty transportation and industrial applications) and to enable long duration energy storage for a clean electric grid. Advancing clean hydrogen and fuel cell technologies directly supports the Biden-Harris Administration’s goals of achieving carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050, benefiting all Americans. This NOFO supports the vision outlined in the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap: affordable clean hydrogen for a net-zero carbon future and a sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy. The NOFO will target research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) topics critical to scaling hydrogen infrastructure and enabling increased adoption of clean hydrogen across sectors, particularly in heavy-duty (HD) vehicles and other heavy-duty transportation applications, which supports the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization. Increased adoption of hydrogen technologies will help achieve economies of scale and drive down costs, directly supporting the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs (H2Hubs) Program, an $8 billion federal investment to create networks of hydrogen producers, consumers, and local connective infrastructure to accelerate the use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier and a carbon-free input to a number of chemical and industrial processes. Improvements in clean hydrogen technologies will also contribute to the long-term viability of the H2Hubs and other commercial-scale deployments. Activities funded under this NOFO will also align with the H2@Scale Initiative, which aims to advance affordable hydrogen production, transport, storage, and utilization to enable decarbonization and revenue opportunities across multiple sectors. The NOFO’s objectives support DOE’s Hydrogen Shot goal, which targets affordable clean hydrogen production at $1/kg within a decade. Hydrogen and fuel cells can provide benefits and create opportunities for communities that have been historically underserved—such as improving air quality, providing resiliency, and creating jobs, including good-paying union jobs. Consistent with DOE’s commitment to benefit all Americans, this anticipated NOFO will encourage the participation of underserved communities and underrepresented groups. Applicants will be encouraged to form meaningful and substantial partnerships with Minority Serving Institutions (e.g., Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Other Minority Institutions). To support the goal of building a clean and equitable energy economy, projects funded under this NOFO will be expected to (1) advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA); (2) contribute to the Justice40 Initiative7 and other considerations linked with energy and/or environmental justice; and (3) invest in America’s workforce. To ensure these objectives are met, applications must include an RDD&D Community Benefits Plan (CBP) that addresses the three objectives stated above. Hydrogen and fuel cells can help create opportunities and benefits for communities that have been historically underserved, such as improving air quality, providing resiliency, and creating jobs, including good-paying union jobs. Consistent with DOE’s commitment to benefit all Americans, this anticipated NOFO will encourage the participation of underserved communities and underrepresented groups. EERE plans to issue the NOFO before or in October 2024 via the EERE eXCHANGE website https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/. If Applicants wish to receive official notifications and information from EERE regarding this NOFO, they should register in EERE eXCHANGE. When the FOA is released, applications will be accepted only through EERE eXCHANGE. Navigate to TPL-0000058 in EERE Exchange to access the Teaming Partner List for this solicitation. This notice of intent (NOI) is issued so that interested parties are aware of EERE’s intention to issue this NOFO in the near term. All the information contained in this NOI is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this NOI. Once the FOA has been released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential applicants to submit questions.",

            "description": "Amendment 000001 - The RFI has been amended to provide additional time for interested parties to respond. The new submission deadline is September 30, 2024 at 5:00 PM ET. Description Wood is an important renewable source of fuel for residential heat, with 10% of American households (approximately 13 million) burning wood for heat and 2% using wood as their primary heat source. Although wood heaters provide a small percentage of energy used in residences in the United States, the devices are a substantial source of particulate matter emissions. These emissions contain fine particulate matter (PM) along with other pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), toxic air pollutants (e.g., benzene and formaldehyde), and black carbon. Improvements in the design and automation of wood heaters have the potential to significantly reduce emissions and increase efficiency. In addition to wood heater design, proper installation and operation also determine the level of emissions and efficiency of residential wood heaters. As innovation has driven the improved performance of residential wood stoves, they have become more efficient and cleaner burning, as proven by laboratory certification tests. Measuring stoves’ performance as they burn in residences with real user behavior (in-situ) will give more insight into the stoves’ efficiency as well as the indoor and outdoor air quality. Collecting in-situ data will provide both industry and government with information to guide further innovation of cleaner and more efficient wood stoves and the best use of renewable wood feedstocks. Background Since fiscal year 2019 the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), an element of DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), has been the steward of funds to support the development of cleaner burning, higher efficiency residential wood heaters. These funds have supported topics in Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA), Wood Heater Design Challenge (WHDC) competition, a FY23 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) call, and a series of workshops held in 2022. A recommendation from the March 2022 workshop series was to focus on the in-situ testing of wood heaters to better understand their actual performance as influenced by many factors, including but not limited to operator control, chimney design, climate, and wood quality. This RFI seeks further input from stakeholders to define the goals and objectives for a planned effort to collect in-situ wood heater performance data. Purpose The purpose of this RFI is to solicit feedback from industry, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, and other stakeholders on issues and considerations related to testing residential wood stoves in-situ to enable the development of cleaner, more efficient wood heaters. The planned in-situ field data collection effort will monitor wood heater performance in operation by the homeowner rather than an imposed duty cycle in a laboratory environment. EERE is specifically interested in input in identifying the most important parameters to measure, considerations of in-situ test design, data collection methods, operator behavior, and other input surrounding in-situ testing. This is solely a request for information and not a FOA. EERE is not accepting applications. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to woodheat@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on September 30, 2024. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) attachment to the email, and no more than 5 pages in length, 12 point font, 1 inch margins. Only electronic responses will be accepted.

The “Connected Communities 2.0: Innovations to Manage Growing Transportation, Building, and Industrial Loads to the Grid” Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) issued by the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy is designed to address major new loads from transportation, industry, and buildings on the electric grid by providing new tools for users, planners, and operators of the electric grid. This FOA has two major topical areas: 1.  Connected Communities 2.0, focused on grid edge technical measures in  buildings, industry, and transportation to prepare the electric grid for these new loads, and improve the resilience of customers and the grid; and 2.  Smart Charge Management (SCM), focused on various unique urban, suburban, and rural use cases to build confidence in SCM as an effective approach for electric vehicles (EVs) to provide flexibility and value to the electric grid. The learnings from these projects should enable electric system planners and operators, strategic planners, regulators such as Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), and other stakeholders to understand and plan for new load growth and peak loads driven by electrification, growth in manufacturing, and new computing developments; and to plan for physical and cyber threats to reliability and resilience, while keeping costs affordable for customers and ratepayers. To achieve this end, the cohort of awarded projects will pursue three primary goals. First, the cohort will demonstrate how smart and coordinated management of EVs and other distributed energy resources (DERs), including the integration of efficiency, smart electrical panels, solar, heat pumps, controls, EV charging, and storage can together provide grid support, reduce system costs, and improve the economics of customer technology adoption, at a scale sufficient to enable confidence in wide-scale adoption. The second goal is to demonstrate approaches that enable acceptance by utilities, PUCs, and communities of smart charge management, grid-edge technical measures and innovative planning strategies as valid methods towards right sizing investments in the distribution system. The third and final major goal for the cohort is to demonstrate approaches towards improved resilience for communities, end-use customers, and the overall grid in the face of growing loads, extreme weather events, cyber threats, and increasing reliance on the electric grid through the use of grid edge technical measures. This FOA will award an estimated $65M, and is a cross office FOA co-funded by BTO, VTO, SETO, IEDO, GTO, and OE. Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to CCPilotsFOA@ee.doe.gov",

Modification 0001 - See the Modification table in the FOA document. Awards made under this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will be funded, in whole or in part, with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure, which will grow a more sustainable, resilient, and equitable economy through enhancing U.S. competitiveness, driving the creation of good-paying union jobs, and ensuring stronger access to economic, environmental, and other benefits for disadvantaged communities. The BIL appropriates more than $62 billion to the Department of Energy (DOE) to invest in American manufacturing and workers; expand access to energy efficiency; deliver reliable, clean and affordable power to more Americans; and deploy the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations. As part of and in addition to upgrading and modernizing infrastructure, DOE’s BIL investments will address the climate crisis and support efforts to build a clean an equitable energy economy that achieves zero carbon electricity by 2035, and puts the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050 to benefit all Americans. The Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Geothermal Technologies Office’s (GTO) 2022 Enhanced Geothermal Shot TM analysis, building on the 2019 GeoVision report, concludes that with aggressive technology improvements, in areas relevant to enhanced geothermal systems (EGS), geothermal power generation could provide 90 gigawatts-electric (GWe) firm, flexible power to the U.S. grid by 2050. Enhanced Geothermal Systems are engineered geothermal reservoirs, created where there is hot rock (175-300+°C), but little to no natural permeability and/or fluid saturation. During EGS development, subsurface permeability is enhanced via safe, well-engineered reservoir stimulation processes that re-open pre-existing fractures, create new ones, or a combination of both. These open conduits increase permeability and allow fluid to circulate throughout the hot rock. The fluid transports the otherwise stranded heat to the surface where clean, renewable electricity can be generated with current power generation technologies. Relative to other geothermal resources, EGS have the potential to provide the most growth in the electric sector, and in the GeoVision scenarios, support noteworthy growth within the non-electric sector for district heating and other direct-use applications. This potential expands if superhot EGS resources (>375°C) are accounted for. Without significant and sustained investment in EGS technology development and demonstrations to refine our ability to access and develop these resources, however, the 90 GWe target will not be achieved. The Topic Area addressed under this FOA is: Topic Area 4: Eastern-US EGS Demonstrations (OPEN) EGS stimulation demonstration located at a well-characterized Eastern U.S. site, with existing well(s) in place and near-term electrical and/or thermal power production potential. PLEASE DO NOT upload the Letter of Intent or ANY application documents to closed Topic Areas 1, 2, or 3. These will not be accessed or reviewed, applicants risk Topic Area 4 full applications not being retrieved in the eXCHANGE system if submitted incorrectly.

            "description": "The GTO GRID FOA seeks applications from teams focused on geographic regions defined within specific power pools, joint utilities groups, utility service territories, or Tribal jurisdictions in the conterminous U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, or U.S. territories to quantify the value of geothermal power in supporting an equitable transition to a future decarbonized grid and economy. Regional grid modeling studies should use one or more analysis approaches and tools such as capacity expansion modeling, production cost modeling, Loss-of-Load based analyses, machine learning applications, and/or alternate modeling or market design approaches. GTO’s mission is to\nincrease geothermal energy deployment through research, development, and\ndemonstration (RD&D) of innovative technologies that enhance exploration\nand production. Its vision is a vibrant domestic geothermal sector that\ncontributes to a carbon-pollution free electric sector by 2035 and a net-zero\nemission economy by 2050 while providing economic opportunities and\nenvironmental benefits for all Americans. GTO supports geothermal energy\nRD&D activities in six research areas aimed at increased access, reduced\ncosts and improved economics, and improved education and outreach about\ngeothermal resources. DOE’s 2023 Enhanced Geothermal Shot TM analysis concludes\nthat with aggressive technology improvements in areas relevant to enhanced\ngeothermal systems (EGS), geothermal electricity generation could provide 90\nGWe of firm, flexible power to the US electric grid by 2050. Building a clean and\nequitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of\nthe Biden-Harris Administration. This FOA will advance the Biden-Harris\nAdministration’s goals to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and\nto “deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a\npath to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050“ to the\nbenefit of all Americans. DOE is committed to pushing the frontiers of science\nand engineering, catalyzing clean energy jobs through research, development,\ndemonstration, and deployment (RDD&D), and ensuring environmental justice\nand inclusion of underserved communities. Geothermal power\noffers a unique value proposition to support the United States’ target of 100%\ncarbon-pollution-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero emissions economy by\n2050. Traditionally, geothermal power is well understood as a clean, firm\ngeneration resource with a high capacity factor, 24/7 availability, and minimal\nland use footprint. Moreover, the advent of flexible geothermal operations and\ngeothermal power coupled with storage technologies broadens the breadth of\nservices that geothermal power could provide to a decarbonizing grid. This FOA supports\nthe administration goals laid out above by catalyzing regional grid modeling\nstudies that quantify the potential contribution of geothermal power in\nsupporting an equitable transition to a future decarbonized grid and economy.\nThe research and development (R&D) activities to be funded under this FOA\nwill support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving\ninnovation that can lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies, which\nare critical for climate protection. Specifically, this F OA will quantify the\nvalue of geothermal power to a decarbonized grid. General Topic Area: Value of Geothermal\nPower Topic Area Project teams are\nrequired to propose grid modeling and/or analysis approaches tailored to their\nspecific grid region of interest examining one or more of the following\ngeothermal power attributes: a)      Firm capacity to support resource\nadequacy b)      Flexible geothermal power and ancillary\nservices to the grid and/or to a deferrable load c)      Integrated value of geothermal power with\nstorage technologies d)      Total system impact of geothermal power\nto cost of grid decarbonization In addition to\nchoosing one or more of the above attributes for examination, project teams are\nrequired to incorporate elements of understanding geothermal power’s\ncontribution to an equitable transition within the proposal.",

            "description": "In September 2022, the U.S. Departments of Energy, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency executed an historic memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the signatory agencies to accelerate our nation’s affordable and equitable clean transportation future. 1 As a result of the comprehensive decarbonization strategy called for in the MOU, those agencies issued the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization, which set the goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the transportation sector – including off-road equipment – by 2050 2. The Transition to net-zero emission technologies requires coordination among all aspects of the supply chain, including feedstock supply, alternative fuel production, equipment manufacturers, safety implementation, customer demand, and government regulation. To develop a national strategy to decarbonize the sector, three critical questions must be addressed: What is the current state of the off-road vehicle fleet? Which powertrain technologies are most promising for decarbonization of off-road vehicles? What is the timeline for the off-road sector to transition to net-zero emission GHG technologies? “Off-road vehicles are primarily designed to operate away from existing roadways. This category contains a disparate and very diverse set of vehicles and use cases, including construction and mining equipment, industrial equipment, agriculture equipment, lawn and garden equipment, and recreational vehicles.” 1 The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to understand the off-road sector alternative propulsion technology preferences, which technologies seem most promising, and what are the key barriers to achieving the transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. The propulsion technologies under consideration for this RFI are: biodiesel, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, battery electric, direct electrification (catenary), electric hybridization, hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines and hydrogen fuel cells.  Currently, no one alternative propulsion technology is a clear choice for sector decarbonization. This RFI is an attempt to aggregate knowledge from stakeholders to help guide actions regarding future propulsion technologies, research and infrastructure investments, and coordination among key stakeholders to ensure that the off-road sector is meeting or exceeding U.S. decarbonization milestones. This is solely a request for information and not a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). EERE is not accepting applications. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to CleanMachines@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00p.m. (ET) on June 7, 2024. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Preferred responses should be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) (10 page limit) and/or Microsoft Excel (.xslx) attachments to the email. If necessary, a plain text file (.txt) may be submitted. Only electronic responses will be accepted. Please identify your answers by responding to a specific question or topic if applicable. Respondents may answer as many or as few questions as they wish. Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below.

Specifically, this FOA will fund innovative solar photovoltaics (PV) R&D that reduces the cost of PV modules, reduces carbon and energy intensity of PV manufacturing processes, and optimizes PV technology for new, specialized markets. SETO’s PVRD program works to accelerate the deployment of solar energy technologies by funding innovative R&D in PV cell and module technologies, balance-of-system components, reliability tracing and tracking, metrology, and other key research questions in PV. To accelerate toward these deployment targets and augment SETO’s ongoing PV research portfolio,12 this FOA will fund R&D on innovative cell- and minimodule-level technologies focused on three major goals: •Enable cost reduction on an LCOE basis through development of durable, high-efficiency cell and module PV technology •Identify pathways to reduce the carbon intensity and energy intensity of industrial processes required to fabricate PV cells and modules •Increase technical viability of PV cells and modules tailored for emerging integrated PV sectors, such as building-integrated PV (BIPV) and vehicle-integrated PV. This FOA will fund innovative R&D projects that aim to advance the state of the art in various cell and module technologies to accomplish these goals of cost reduction, lower carbon intensity, and viability of dual-use markets. This FOA is separated into two topic areas: •Photovoltaic Advances in Cell Efficiency, Reliability, and Supply Chain (PACERS): Applications in four PV supply chain, cell, and module technology spaces are of particular interest: low-carbon synthesis of metallurgical-grade silicon (MGS, here defined as silicon that is 98% pure as defined by the 5/5/3 standard)13 production, crystalline silicon (c-Si) PV, III-V PV, and organic PV (OPV). However, proposals for any industrial process, cell, or minimodule-level research that enables the goals of this FOA will be considered, excluding areas specified as not of interest in Section I.C., such as perovskite technology, which is addressed in other funding programs, and CdTe technology, which is addressed in Topic Area 2. •Building Academic Capabilities in Cadmium Telluride: Applications describing advanced R&D projects requiring the procurement or upgrade of CdTe equipment are of interest. Proposals should detail work that will enhance fabrication, characterization, or analytical capabilities while also benefiting the larger CdTe PV research community.",

NOTE: in response to recent SAM.gov registration questions, see the clarification at the bottom of this description. DE-FOA-0003072: WASTE: Waste Analysis and Strategies for Transportation End-uses The research and development (R&D) activities to be funded under this FOA will support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving the innovation that can lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection. Specifically, this FOA will aid communities with resource and energy recovery strategies associated with their organic waste streams. Organic waste streams represent major sources of fugitive methane emissions, volatile organic compounds, and other pollutants. The White House set a goal of reducing methane emissions by 30% by 2030. By developing strategies that can prevent the landfilling of these wastes, one of the major sources of fugitive methane can be mitigated. Holistic waste management strategies can also benefit communities by reducing other impacts associated with waste collection and processing infrastructure including reducing truck traffic, odors, litter, and other air, water, and health impacts. Topic Area 1 is focused specifically on helping communities beyond a conceptualization phase by supporting more in-depth feasibility or scoping analysis. Oftentimes, staff and organizational capacity in communities (particularly in rural, remote, Tribal, or smaller communities) is limited. While technical assistance programs can accomplish some of these objectives, direct financial assistance can close this capacity gap. Topic Area 2 is targeted towards communities that have previously completed feasibility analysis and are seeking funding to further refine their project concept. Municipal and non-profit staff capacity and availability of funding often makes detailed design work out of reach for many communities and this topic aims to close that gap. Projects selected under Topic Area 2 will have an opportunity to construct and operate their designed pilot facility based on the down-select process described in the FOA. Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to FY24WASTEFOA@ee.doe.gov. Note: DE-FOA-0003072 is a competitive solicitation and private discussions, while the announcement is open, are prohibited. All questions regarding this FOA must be submitted via email to FY24WASTEFOA@ee.doe.gov no later than three business days prior to the application due date.  All questions and answers related to this FOA will be posted in EERE eXCHANGE under DOCUMENTS for DE-FOA-0003072. The eXCHANGE system is currently designed to enforce hard deadlines for Concept Paper and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the FOA Deadline: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@ee.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues. Applicants that experience issues with submissions that result in a late submission: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission that results in a late submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@ee.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues (including finalizing the submission on behalf of, and with the Applicant's concurrence). DOE will only accept late applications when the Applicant has a) encountered technical difficulties beyond their control; b) has contacted the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance; and c) has submitted the application through eXCHANGE within 24 hours of the FOA's posted deadline. Please see the full FOA in the DOCUMENTS section below. Clarification about SAM.gov requirements: The prime applicant may submit a concept paper prior to completion of the SAM.gov registration. This FOA does not require a UEI number to be included with the concept paper and may require a UEI registration at the time of full application submission. Applicants are strongly encouraged to complete the SAM registration prior to submitting a full application. If selected for an award, as stated in Section IV.G. of the FOA \"DOE may not make a federal award to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable UEI and SAM requirements. If an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time DOE is ready to make a federal award, DOE will determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a federal award and use that determination as a basis for making a federal award to another applicant.\"",

Additionally, the expected number of awards in Topic Area 1 has been updated. Building a clean and equitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration. This FOA will advance the Biden Administration’s goals to deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050 to the benefit of all Americans. This FOA is funded by two Department of Energy (DOE) offices: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management’s (FECM) Carbon Conversion Program. BETO’s primary focus is on developing technologies that convert domestic biomass and/or waste resources to affordable biofuels and bioproducts that significantly reduce carbon emissions on a life-cycle basis as compared to equivalent petroleum-based products. These bioenergy technologies can enable a transition to a clean energy economy, create high-quality jobs, support rural economies, and spur innovation in renewable energy and chemicals production. The activities funded by BETO through this funding opportunity will mobilize public clean energy investment by addressing research and development (R&D) challenges in the conversion of various seaweeds and blends of seaweeds (with wet waste feedstocks such as waste microalgae) to low-carbon fuels and chemicals. These activities can also help develop solutions for communities that are affected by harmful algal blooms to reduce the costs associated with managing these wastes. The priority of FECM’s Carbon Conversion Program is to develop multiple pathways by which captured and concentrated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is converted into economically viable and environmentally sustainable products. The near-term objective of this program’s R&D is to accelerate deployment of carbon management technologies through the conversion of CO2 into value-added products. Under this FOA, applications are sought that use anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in the cultivation process and then convert macro and/or micro algae into low carbon products. Conversion for agricultural products such as animal feed are of particular interest. Algae is a promising type of renewable biomass-based feedstock with the potential to contribute to BETO’s and FECM’s missions and help meet the aggressive clean energy goals being pursued by DOE. For purposes of this FOA, “algae” includes microalgae, cyanobacteria, and macroalgae (also referred to as seaweed).  All types of algae may be of interest to this FOA, subject to the topic-specific requirements described in each Topic Area.

Expected date for selection notifications has been moved to 10/1 and timeframe for negotiations has been moved to October-December 2024. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is jointly issued by the U.S. Department of Energy Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) and Wind Energy Technologies Office (WETO) as part of their Interconnection Innovation Exchange (i2X) program1 to support innovative work to enable simpler, faster, and fairer interconnection of clean energy resources while enhancing the reliability, resiliency, and security of our electrical grid. The two FOA topic areas are as follows: Topic Area 1: Improved Efficiency of EMT Simulations for Interconnection Studies of IBRs Projects in this topic area will seek to improve the efficiency of the interconnection study process for new IBRs, such as solar and wind plants and battery energy storage systems, by improving software tools to study plant dynamics to increase long-term plant reliability. Projects will achieve this both by improving the speed of advanced, high-fidelity EMT modeling and simulation tools used in power systems interconnection studies and by developing a better understanding of when such high-fidelity simulations are necessary in the interconnection process. Topic Area 2: Dynamic Stability-Enhanced Network Assessment Tools Projects in this topic area will develop tools to provide stakeholders with data on transmission system characteristics related to stability, voltage, and grid strength while securing confidential and critical energy infrastructure information. Projects will establish the type of information required by stakeholders, develop a tool or tools, and test and evaluate those tools on at least one real transmission system. Topic Area 1 is primarily focused on the improvement of software tools, methods, or processes used to conduct EMT studies, the results of which will inform the transmission system interconnection stakeholders in Topic Area 2. Projects in Topic Area 2 do not need to be focused solely on transmission system characteristics based on EMT studies.",

            "description": "The research and development (R&D) activities to be funded under this lab call will support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving the innovation that can lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection. Specifically, this lab call will enable innovation in research areas aligned to the WPTO Hydropower Program. In addition, this lab call will emphasize increasing diversity of research staff, increasing diversity of voices in research design, and or increasing quantification and emphasis on supporting underserved communities This lab call solicits proposals in seven topics that cover three of the five core activity areas in the Hydropower Program, including one program-wide topic supporting the Federal Hydropower Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and DOE’s MOU with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The three Hydropower Program activity areas and their supporting topics are: HydroWIRES (Water Innovation for Resilient Electricity System) Activity Area (4 topics) Topic 1: Modeling Gaps In partnership with Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC), an ongoing HydroWIRES Modeling Gaps project is focusing on developing new models and implementing them with the goal of creating public tools to include robust and updated scenarios for utility planning. Previous work identified seven top modeling gaps to representation of hydropower in power system models. This topic solicits proposals that focus on continued partnership with WECC model users and other practitioners to improve hydro generation representation in power system studies for operation and planning. Topic 2: Future Grid Strength HydroWIRES work has highlighted the role of hydropower in providing primary frequency response, ramping, and other benefits during contingency events. While previous studies have offered valuable anecdotes and modeling frameworks, a more comprehensive look at the unique benefits of hydropower at the timescales of grid stability has not been developed yet. This topic solicits proposals that will be comprehensive, national-scale modeling efforts (but with regional insight) that address the unique benefits of hydropower at the timescales of grid stability. Topic 3: US-Norway Collaboration Norway is a world leader in hydropower technology, operations, and modeling, which inspired a 2020 US-Norway MOU and international research summit. As HydroCen, the flagship Norwegian research consortium under which these projects were started, concludes, there are new Norwegian and/or European initiatives being launched with similar research themes that may lead to new fruitful international collaborations. This topic solicits new research projects aligned with the HydroWIRES roadmap that are not captured in the existing portfolio or other topics in this call, which are performed in collaboration with Norwegian researchers and/or partners. Topic 4: Open Topic This open topic solicits new ideas not captured in the existing HydroWIRES portfolio. Proposals should clearly further the goals of HydroWIRES as described in the research roadmap, and the application should explain how they do this. Collaborations with industry or other external entities outside the labs to co-design, validate, and implement National Lab results are highly encouraged. Hydrologic Systems Science Activity Area (1 topic): Topic 5: Extreme Weather and Climate Events: Extreme events can have devastating effects on the country’s infrastructure, including power generation facilities, and climate change is only increasing the intensity and frequency of extreme events like heat waves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, inland flooding, and heavy precipitation. This topic solicits new research projects addressing extreme weather and climate events and their effects on hydropower infrastructure, operation, and planning. Proposals of interest will focus on one or more of the following: event classification, modeling, impact quantification, and mitigation and resilience strategies. Fleet Modernization, Maintenance, & Cybersecurity Activity Area (1 topic): Topic 6: Smart Maintenance Implementation Assistance Traditionally, hydropower owners and operators’ maintenance programs have followed prescriptive, time-based maintenance and inspection programs. These programs may lose asset value by conducting maintenance earlier than needed or may not properly adapt to changing operating conditions (e.g., due to increased need for turbine flexibility) leading to increased failure rates. Predictive maintenance mitigates these challenges by using instrumentation, modeling, and data analytics to understand the remaining useful life and failure probabilities of an asset in real time. This topic solicits projects that accelerate the transition to smart maintenance methodologies by streamlining the implementation of new and existing maintenance analytics resources at existing hydropower facilities through programmatic assistance to hydropower asset owners and operators. The one Hydropower Program-wide topic is: Topic 7: Federal Hydropower MOU Federally owned hydropower represents approximately half of the U.S. hydropower nameplate capacity, including many of the largest facilities in the fleet. Maintaining and modernizing this federal fleet requires significant investment and coordination. WPTO supports this coordination through two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU): This pilot effort topic solicits “quick win” collaborative projects that minimize bandwidth required and solve targeted challenges within the federal hydro fleet.",

Inflation Reduction Act Funding for Advanced Biofuels FOA DE-FOA-0003178 BETO’s 2024 Systems Development and Integration (SDI) FOA is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. IRA Section 60108(b) authorized funds to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for new grants to industry in advanced biofuels. EPA and DOE entered an Interagency Agreement to transfer the funds to DOE and allow DOE to manage a FOA with substantial involvement from EPA. The FOA’s topic areas are of mutual interest for both the EPA’s priority in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and DOE BETO’s priority in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Grand Challenge as well as SDI’s priority in supporting four demonstration-scale integrated biorefineries by 2030. For both topic areas of this FOA, the application must discuss how the proposed technology would meet the RFS definition of advanced biofuel, which means using allowable feedstocks, producing allowable fuel types, and with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 50% compared to petroleum baseline. Building a clean and equitable energy economy and addressing the climate crisis is a top priority of the Biden Administration. This FOA will advance the Biden Administration’s goals to deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050 to the benefit of all Americans. For over a decade, EPA’s RFS program has helped develop the market for advanced biofuels, including the current production of billions of gallons of biomass-based diesel and renewable natural gas. These fuels reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% compared to the petroleum fuels they replace. As shown in the RFS Program: Standards for 2023-2025 final rule, the RFS continues to expand by increasing renewable volume obligations, while monitoring how renewable fuel production impacts the environment, national energy security, national infrastructure, the cost of fuels to consumers, and the impacts on job creation, agricultural commodity prices and supplies, rural economic development, and food prices. There is a need for more feedstocks and conversion technologies to enable more advanced biofuels with the lowest cost of production and the greatest reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. DOE is committed to pushing the frontiers of science and engineering, catalyzing clean energy jobs through research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D), and ensuring environmental justice and inclusion of underserved communities. This FOA will support the Biden Administration’s action items to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year and reduce aviation emissions by 20% by 2030 towards unlocking the potential for a fully zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050. This FOA also supports high-impact technology R&D to accelerate the bioeconomy. BETO is focusing on applied RD&D to improve the performance and reduce the cost of biofuel production technologies and scale-up production systems in partnership with industry. By reducing cost and technical risk, BETO can help pave the way for industry to deploy commercial-scale integrated biorefineries and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as the aviation industry.  Additionally, this FOA will reduce risks in processing or co-processing biointermediates in legacy refinery infrastructure. Topic Area 1: Pre-pilot Scale-Up of Integrated Biorefinery Technologies Topic Area 2: Biointermediate Processing Toolbox Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to IRAAdvancedBiofuelsFOA@ee.doe.gov . The eXCHANGE system is currently designed to enforce hard deadlines for Concept Paper and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the FOA Deadline: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@ee.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues. Applicants that experience issues with submissions that result in a late submission: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission that results in a late submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov).

            "description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Bioenergy Technology Office (BETO) and the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled MACRO: “Mixed Algae Conversion Research Opportunity”. If issued, this FOA will support BETO’s research and development (R&D) priorities in the Conversion Technologies Program and FECM’s R&D priorities in the Carbon Dioxide Conversion Program. BETO’s Conversion Technologies Program supports R&D in technologies for converting biomass feedstocks into finished liquid transportation fuels—such as renewable gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel along with co-products or chemical intermediates. FECM’s Carbon Dioxide Conversion Program invests in R&D of technologies that convert captured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into economically valuable products such as chemicals, fuels, building materials, plastics, and bioproducts. The R&D activities to be funded under this FOA will support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving the innovation that can lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies, which are critical for climate protection. A diverse range of feedstocks will be required to reach the Biden Administration’s goals to “deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.”[1] Seaweeds, also known as macroalgae, represent a significant biomass resource potential of 3.3 billion dry metric tons that will be newly described in BETO’s upcoming Billion Ton Report. Rapid growth of the seaweed cultivation industry, in part inspired by the DOE ARPA-E (Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy) MARINER (Macroalgae Research Inspiring Novel Energy Resources) program efforts, has spurred new interest in working with seaweeds as a renewable biomass feedstock. Due to the expansion of domestic cultivation and the potential of seaweeds to contribute to DOE’s mission areas, this announcement is the first time BETO and FECM have specifically called for research into converting seaweeds to fuels and products. It is anticipated that the FOA may include the following Topic Areas: Topic Area 1: Conversion of Seaweeds and Waste Algae to Low Carbon Fuels and Products Topic Area 1 aims to address gaps in storage, mobilization, and conversion of seaweeds and other wet algal feedstocks to low-carbon products and enable these readily available feedstocks to access new markets. Applications would be sought that will develop laboratory or bench scale technologies and/or processes for utilizing: macroalgae (seaweeds); blends of macroalgae and wet wastes, and/or wet algal wastes for conversion to fuels and products with significant, on a national scale, potential to displace fossil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Applications will be required to demonstrate that the utilization of these feedstocks to generate products at commercial scale has the potential of at least 50% GHG reductions compared to conventional fuel and/or products. Topic Area 2: Conversion of Algal Biomass for Low Carbon Agricultural Products The goal of Topic Area 2 is to utilize carbon dioxide emissions streams from utilities or industrial sources to grow algae for source material and create value-added products. Applications would be sought that use anthropogenic (e.g., fossil fuel derived) carbon dioxide emissions to be used in the algae cultivation process and then convert those macro- and/or micro algae into low-carbon agricultural applications or products such as animal feed. Applications will be encouraged to focus on optimization of the technologies and processes for the conversion of cultivated algae biomass to products and clearly describe the end use products targeted. Applications will be required to show a reduction in CO 2 emissions through life cycle analysis and demonstrate that the targeted products provide benefits compared to current, commercially available products. Applications proposing animal feed as products should describe requirements for necessary testing or demonstrations of the resulting product. Developing successful conversion technologies can further improve, the economics and carbon utilization efficiencies of these products, resulting in additional market share that encourages further algae biomass cultivation and carbon dioxide utilization. Please note: If a FOA is published, DOE’s government-owned, government-operated (GOGO) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) will not be eligible for award under the FOA and may not be proposed as a Subrecipient on another entity’s application. An application that includes NETL as a Prime Recipient or Subrecipient will be considered non-responsive. Additionally, DOE/NNSA and non-DOE/NNSA Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) will be restricted from applying for funding as a Prime Recipient but are eligible to participate as a Subrecipient. The FFRDC effort, in aggregate, shall not exceed 50% of the total estimated cost of the project, including the applicant’s and the FFRDC’s portions of the effort. This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the EERE’s intention to issue this FOA in the near term. All of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this Notice. Once the FOA has been released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential Applicants to submit questions. EERE plans to issue the FOA in or around March 2024 via the EERE eXCHANGE website https://eere-eXCHANGE.energy.gov/. If Applicants wish to receive official notifications and information from EERE regarding this FOA, they should register in EERE eXCHANGE. When the FOA is released, applications will be accepted only through EERE eXCHANGE. [1] Executive Order 14008, “Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad,” January 27, 2021.",

            "description": "Amendment 000001 - The FOA has been amended in sections I.B. and Appendix H. Significant RD&D is required to reach the goal of affordable, low-carbon Intensity transportation fuels and chemical products. The RD&D activities to be funded under this FOA will support the government-wide approach to addressing the climate crisis by driving innovation and deployment of clean energy technologies. The 2024 Regional Resource Hubs for Purpose-Grown Energy Crops FOA supports the focus of the BETO Renewable Carbon Resources Program in developing strategies and supporting technology development to reduce the cost, improve the quality, increase the quantity, and maximize the environmental benefits of using renewable carbon resources. The FOA addresses enabling the mobilization of low carbon intensity purpose-grown energy crops across varied agronomic and geographic landscapes through the generation of data and research findings. The FOA seeks applications that will support resource mobilization, including improvements to quality, yield, cost, mechanization of propagation/planting systems, pest management, carbon intensity reduction, ecosystem services, and more from the cultivation of purpose-grown energy crops. Data generated over the course of four to ten years will be used to improve modeling projections, adapt crops and/or crop management strategies to address varying climates, understand variations in soil and belowground carbon storage, quantify ecosystem services, and reduce the carbon intensity for specified purpose-grown energy crop systems. There is a single Topic Area in this FOA with four Subtopic Areas, each focusing on different feedstock categories. The Topic Area in this FOA seeks to address the following R&D needs: Topic Area 1:  Purpose-Grown Energy Crops The objective this Topic Area is to fund projects that will enable the mobilization of low carbon intensity purpose-grown energy crops across varied agronomic and geographic landscapes through the generation of data and research findings. Each application selected from this FOA will become a member of the larger Regional Biomass Resource Hub Initiative (RBRH) that will work together with BETO’s established Regional Resource Hub Initiative Coordinator, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to coordinate experimental plans, report data, and collectively achieve the FOA and Initiative objectives. Each submitted application must specify only one of the following Subtopic Areas. Subtopic Area 1a.  Algae The objective of Subtopic Area 1a is to support projects that seek to cultivate and harvest as much algae from their given system(s) as possible each year for at least three years. The deliberate cultivation of algae with non-potable water, including all types of microalgae, cyanobacteria, and macroalgae, and algae grown to treat wastewaters is of interest. Subtopic Area 1b:  Herbaceous Energy Crops Subtopic Area 1b is centered on enhancing the mobilization of low-carbon intensity herbaceous energy crops across varied agronomic landscapes. For the purposes of Subtopic Area 1b, “herbaceous energy crops” is defined as perennial plants and grasses that live for more than two years and are harvested annually after taking two to three years to reach full productivity. Examples of herbaceous energy crops include, but are not limited to, switchgrass, miscanthus, high-biomass sorghum, wheatgrass, and energycane. Subtopic Area 1c:  Intermediate Energy Crops For the purposes of Subtopic Area 1c, “intermediate energy crops” are defined as crops planted between the harvest of a main crop and sowing of the next crop. Typically grown for environmental benefits such as increasing soil carbon or reducing nutrient leaching and soil erosion, intermediate energy crops have the additional potential to be harvested for conversion into low carbon intensity fuels and products. Subtopic Area 1d:  Short-Rotation Woody Crops Subtopic Area 1d is focused on enhancing the mobilization of short-rotation woody crops across various geographic landscapes by performing regional field trials to examine long term yield and sustainability. For the purposes of Subtopic Area 1d, “short-rotation woody crops” is defined as fast-growing trees that are harvested within five to eight years of planting. Such trees include, but may not be limited to, species such as, hybrid poplar and shrub willow. Please note: Due to INL’s role as Initiative Coordinator and involvement in FOA strategy discussions, INL is not eligible to apply for funding as a Prime Recipient under the FOA and may not be proposed as a Subrecipient on another entity’s application. Any application that includes INL as a Prime Recipient or Subrecipient will be deemed ineligible, non-responsive, and will not be further considered. Please see the full FOA document in the Documents section below. Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to FY24RRHCropsFOA@ee.doe.gov. The required Concept Paper due date for this FOA is 3/14/2024 at 5PM ET. The Full Application due date for this FOA is 06/13/2024 at 5PM ET.

            "description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is issuing Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DE-FOA-0003296 on behalf of the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO).  GTO actively pursues research, development, and demonstration projects to facilitate technology validation and demonstration, reduce cost, and improve performance of geothermal technologies. The economic viability of geothermal projects across the resource spectrum depends on developing and improving enabling technologies and detailed understanding of the subsurface, including geologic qualities, permeability, and other attributes. This funding opportunity comprises two topic areas with separate objectives and technical focus. Topic Area 1 : High-Temperature Tools for Well Integrity Evaluation Topic Area 1 seeks applications to address ​​wellbore tools and technology to supplement and advance beyond currently available off-the-shelf (OTS) solutions provided by the oil and gas industry for cement and casing evaluation. Current solutions are suitable for the upper end of the oil and gas industry’s temperature needs but are not generally considered adequate for use in hotter, EGS systems. As advancements and novel methods in casing and cementing are implemented, a critical, early element of success is evaluating their efficacy. Given the harsh conditions often encountered in geothermal borehole environments, obtaining quality inspection and confirmation information can be a costly and difficult task. The projects selected under Topic Area 1 of this FOA will seek to address the availability of downhole cement and casing evaluation tools for use in high temperature and hostile geothermal wellbores. Topic Area 2 : Utilization of Reservoir Thermal Energy Storage (RTES) Technology for Decarbonization of Industrial Processes Topic Area 2 seeks to demonstrate low-temperature (<130 ◦ C) RTES technology with applications to industrial processes such as melting plastic, removing moisture, treating chemicals, and others. RTES takes advantage of large subsurface storage capacities, geothermal gradients, and thermal insulation associated with deep geologic formations to store thermal energy to be extracted in the future for beneficial use on a variety of timescales. The activities funded through this FOA will advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s goals to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035 and achieve a net-zero-emissions economy by 2050. Strategic goals for this FOA are derived from DOE’s Enhanced Geothermal Shot and its associated roadmap, and GTO’s GeoVision Roadmap and Multi-Year Program Plan. Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to HT.Tools.RTES.FOA@ee.doe.gov The Teaming Partner List will remain open and will be updated at least weekly until the close of the Full Application period, to reflect new Teaming Partners who have provided their information. Applicants must submit a Letter of Intent by 5:00pm ET on the due date listed in the FOA to be eligible to submit a Full Application. Letter of Intent and Full Applications will only be accepted through EERE eXCHANGE. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the Deadline : In the event an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE system is designed to enforce hard deadlines for Letter of Intentand Full Application submissions. The “APPLY” and “SUBMIT” buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants.",

If issued, this FOA will support the Bioenergy Technologies Office’s research and development (R&D) priorities in the area of Renewable Carbon Resources (RCR). The RCR subprogram develops science and engineering-based strategies and technologies to cost-effectively transform renewable carbon resources into high-quality, environmentally sustainable, conversion-ready feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts. These strategies and technologies are designed to improve the efficiency, sustainability, and reliability of feedstock production, harvesting or collection, storage, preprocessing, and transportation, and identify the key feedstock quality and operational variables for conversion performance. Developing a domestic supply chain of purpose-grown energy crops is critical to decarbonizing the U.S. transportation and industrial sectors and can contribute to decarbonization of adjacent sectors of the economy, such as the agricultural and power sector. The Regional Resource Hubs for Purpose-Grown Energy Crops FOA will address the U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization by funding high-impact R&D focused on mobilizing low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops.  These crops will support the Clean Fuels and Products Shot™ and contribute to the 2050 sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production targets of the SAF Grand Challenge. In order to verify greenhouse gas benefits and encourage grower adoption and deployment, long-term yield and sustainability of production crop varieties need to be demonstrated along with the agricultural and silvicultural practices that can provide low carbon intensity feedstocks for the production of renewable fuels and products. It is anticipated that the FOA may include the following Area of Interest: Area of Interest (AOI) 1:  Purpose-Grown Energy Crops The goal of this AOI will be to demonstrate the long-term yield and sustainability of purpose-grown energy crops across varied agronomic and geographic landscapes that will accelerate feedstock supply chain development through the generation of data for use by analysts, policy makers, and industry. Verification and validation of the effectiveness of improved agronomic practices on reducing the carbon intensity of biomass resources across multiple regions, feedstock types, and growing seasons will also be essential to meet the 85% GHG emission reduction goal of the Clean Fuels and Products Shot™ compared to fossil-based sources by 2035. Feedstocks of interest include, but are not limited to, algae (microalgae, macroalgae, and cyanobacteria), herbaceous crops (switchgrass, miscanthus, energy cane, sweet sorghum, and high-biomass sorghum), short-rotation woody crops (hybrid poplars and shrub willows), and intermediate crops (carinata, pennycress, and camelina). Each application selected from this FOA will become a member of the Regional Biomass Resource Hub Initiative that will work together with DOE’s established Regional Biomass Resource Hub Initiative Coordinator, Idaho National Laboratory (INL), to coordinate experimental plans, report data, and collectively achieve the FOA objectives. Selected projects will be mapped to a Regional Biomass Resource Hub (RBRH) based on the proposed feedstock(s) and region(s) included in their application. Please note: Due to INL’s role as Initiative Coordinator and involvement in FOA strategy discussions, INL is not eligible to apply for funding as a Prime Recipient under the FOA and may not be proposed as a Subrecipient on another entity’s application. Any application that includes INL as a Prime Recipient or Subrecipient will be deemed ineligible, non-responsive, and will not be further considered.

Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below. The U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization set the goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in the transportation sector – including rail – by 2050.[1] This transformation requires coordination among all aspects of the rail supply chain including feedstock supply, alternative fuel production, locomotive engine manufacturers, safety implementation, customer demand, and government regulation. To set domestic rail on an ambitious net-zero emission trajectory, commercially viable, well-to-wheel net-zero emission line-haul locomotives are needed in the domestic fleet by 2030. Thus, an ambitious alliance is needed between the private sector, research institutes and regulatory entities to develop, demonstrate, and deploy net-zero locomotives and infrastructure together by 2030 to make net-zero propulsion the natural choice for railroads. The propulsion technologies under consideration for this RFI for transitional, interim use until 2030 are : biodiesel, renewable diesel, ammonia, methanol, hydrogen fueled internal combustion engines, and ethanol. The technologies under consideration for this RFI for mid- to long-term use are : hydrogen fuel cells, batteries (tenders or built-in), and direct electrification (catenary), or a combination of different technologies. Each alternative propulsion technology comes with its own set of regionally sensitive advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this RFI is to aggregate knowledge from rail stakeholders to help direct actions regarding future propulsion technologies, infrastructure requirements, and coordination among key stakeholders to ensure that the rail sector is meeting or exceeding U.S. decarbonization milestones. DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is specifically interested in information on the rail sector stakeholder’s current alternative fuels trajectory, the driving forces behind it, and the key barriers to achieving this transition. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to GreenRail@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on February 12 th , 2024 . Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) attachment to the email, and no more than 15 pages in length, 12 point font, 1 inch margins. Only electronic responses will be accepted. This is solely a request for information and not a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). EERE is not accepting applications. Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below.

            "description": "This lab call represents the combined effort of fourteen different U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) program offices and the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT). This solicitation offers an opportunity for private industry to partner with DOE’s National Labs to advance energy-related National Lab-developed technology toward commercialization and to reduce the barriers to commercializing lab-developed energy-related technologies and IP. The intent is to increase the volume and speed to which energy-related lab-developed technologies make it to market from an improved lab commercialization ecosystem. For Fiscal Year 2024 (FY24), DOE continues to implement the previous year’s (FY23) approach for TCF Base Annual Appropriations addressing persistent barriers, bridging known gaps that deter the commercialization of laboratory technologies, and identifying where improvements are still needed. The intent of the Commercialization Enabling Topics (Topics 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of this lab call) is to fill in missing infrastructure pieces and strengthen those already there by addressing core commercialization challenges, barriers, and gaps, as well as their root causes (inside and outside of the labs). Additionally, the lab call will seek proposals from DOE’s National Labs to advance the commercialization of individual energy-related technologies (Topic 4).

If issued, this FOA will support the development of planning and strategies for utilizing organic waste as a feedstock for various transportation fuel end products. For many communities, organic waste streams present a variety of economic, environmental, and social sustainability challenges. These waste streams include food waste, municipal wastewater sludges, animal manure, fats, oils, and greases. There are significant costs associated with management of organic waste, including treatment, stabilization, hauling, and disposal costs or tipping fees. These waste streams also represent major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to other environmental issues including air and water quality degradation. Increasingly, State and local laws and regulations are requiring that organic waste streams be diverted from landfills, necessitating the implementation of new processing strategies and development of novel business models to meet these requirements. Municipal entities and local transit authorities also have significant local demand for the energy that can be derived from these waste streams. There are examples where waste-derived biogas or renewable natural gas [1] (RNG) are being used to fuel bus fleets and trash collection vehicles or produce hydrogen for hydrogen-fueled vehicles. These opportunities are often community-specific, and the planned FOA is intended to help communities realize these or similar synergies between waste infrastructure and sustainable transportation needs. Permissible fuels from projects funded under this FOA could include renewable natural gas, partially upgraded biogas, hydrogen, biocrude, renewable diesel, renewable di-methyl-ether, or others. [1] Note: unless otherwise indicated, for purposes of this FOA, “renewable natural gas” is biogas that has been upgraded to pipeline standard gas and/or another pipeline-transportable, fungible standard. Recognizing that communities may be at different stages in their planning efforts, the planned FOA will seek a phased approach to achieve the outcomes described above. Topic Area 1 is intended to support feasibility studies. For communities that may have already identified potential solutions for their waste/transportation needs, Topic Area 2 would support more detailed engineering design work to position these entities for future projects and demonstrations. It is therefore anticipated the FOA may include the following Areas of Interest: Topic Area 1 is aimed at helping move communities beyond a conceptualization phase by supporting in-depth feasibility analysis relating to waste-to-fuels approaches. While technical assistance programs can accomplish some of these objectives, direct financial assistance can close this capacity gap. Topic Area 2 is targeted toward communities that have previously completed feasibility analyses and are seeking funding to further refine their project concept. Lack of municipal and non-profit staff capacity and availability of funding often puts detailed design work out of reach for many communities; Topic Area 2 is intended to close that gap for completing detailed engineering design. Topic Area 2 will also allow a limited amount of experimental work, intended to generate the data required to refine the engineering design and/or data needed for permitting or air quality analysis. The experimental work can either take place on-site or be done remotely, provided the waste streams being used are sourced from the recipient community. Model waste streams will not be permitted. The use of real waste streams (as opposed to model waste streams) will increase the likelihood of technical success by ensuring the process is sufficiently robust. This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the EERE’s intention to issue these FOAs in the near term. All of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this Notice. Once the FOAs have been released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential Applicants to submit questions. EERE plans to issue the FOAs in or around December 2023 via the EERE eXCHANGE website https://eere-eXCHANGE.energy.gov/ . If Applicants wish to receive official notifications and information from EERE regarding these FOAs, they should register in EERE eXCHANGE. When the FOAs are released, applications will be accepted only through EERE eXCHANGE.",

            "description": "This notice is intended to announce a potential FOA that will aim to advance the strategies identified in the Industrial Decarbonization Roadmap and support the goals of the Industrial Heat Shot™ through a focus on cross-sector approaches for industrial decarbonization. Cross-sector technologies are decarbonization- enabling components, equipment, and systems that underpin processes and products across the industrial sector. Key themes of IEDO’s strategy for cross-sector technologies include: 1.  Transforming electricity into useful industrial heat cost competitively and without putting undue stress on the grid; 2.  Developing combustion systems that enable fuel switching to hydrogen and other low- carbon fuels; 3.  Developing systems for the onsite production, storage, delivery, and recovery of energy; 4.  Reducing barriers to the integration of low-carbon electricity with industrial loads; 5.  Improving the energy efficiency of industrial processes; and 6.  Reducing the energy used for industrial water and wastewater treatment. The FOA will address a subset of these priorities, as described in the topics listed below. Topics 1 and 2 are anticipated to allow for multiple tiers of funding: a lower tier for research and development-only projects and a higher tier for projects that include scope for technology demonstration integrated into industrial operations. All topics are expected to allow applications between Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 and 7. Topic Area 1 - Electrification of Industrial Heat Topic Area 2 - Next-Generation Energy Systems Topic Area 3 - Decarbonizing Organic Wastewater and Wet Waste Treatment EERE plans to issue the FOA on or about November 2023 via the EERE eXCHANGE website https://eere-eXCHANGE.energy.gov/.

Rules and required forms for Full Applications are available on the HeroX website. EPIC Round 3 Overview: The Energy Program for Innovation Clusters (EPIC) Round 3 is a $4 million to $9 million (pending FY24 appropriations) program to support incubators developing new programs that support energy entrepreneurs and startups. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE’s) Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) developed EPIC to encourage robust growth of regional energy innovation ecosystems across the United States. Innovation ecosystems, or clusters, increase the productivity of startups, drive the direction and pace of innovation, and stimulate the formation of new businesses, which further reinforces the cluster itself. In this program, (DOE) seeks to fund organizations that aid in the development of new business ventures, including incubators, accelerators, co-working startup communities, or any other organizations that self-identify as advocates for innovation and entrepreneurship. DOE encourages these organizations to compete in EPIC. This program consists of five components: 1. Phase 1 - Prize Competition: Competitors will design a minimum viable program (MVP) and demonstrate that they have a plan, access to the right networks, and the skills and expertise to successfully implement their MVP. It is expected that during Phase 1, competitors solicit and incorporate feedback from key stakeholders on their program design to ensure they can start implementing quickly in Phase 2. Any non-governmental entity that meets the eligibility requirements can apply to Phase 1. Winners will each receive a $150,000 cash prize. 2. Phase 2 – Prize Competition Resulting in a Cooperative Agreement : Only winners of Phase 1 are eligible to compete in Phase 2. In Phase 2, competitors will begin implementation of their MVP and should move as quickly as possible from MVP planning and program design to implementation. It is expected that by the end of Phase 2, competitors have recruited startups, successfully implemented a portion of their MVP, can speak to progress toward the metrics proposed in Phase 1, and have developed a 3-year plan to transition from MVP to full program. Winners of Phase 2 will enter directly into negotiations with OTT for a $1,000,000 multiyear cooperative agreement to scale their MVP. 3. Cooperative Agreement: The cooperative agreement will provide the winners of EPIC Phase 2 with a multiyear, stable source of funding - contingent on satisfactory performance of agreed upon goals - to scale the highest potential EPIC MVPs to support energy tech startups and grow their regional innovation ecosystems. All cooperative agreements will be governed by 2CFR200 and 2CFR910. 4. Startup Pitch Competitions : As part of EPIC, OTT and NREL will host at least two national pitch competitions for energy-related startups. The competing startups will be nominated by EPIC winners (past and present). Competing startups must be focused on hard-tech development. $105,000 is available to energy-related startups for each pitch competition. 5. Bonus Prizes: EPIC is intended to serve as a scalable and replicable framework for efficiently deploying support to incubators serving energy entrepreneurs and startups. At any time, DOE Technical Program Offices may leverage this framework by sponsoring one or more Bonus Prizes up to $600,000 in additional prizes. These Bonus Prizes may be added to any of the three previous categories (Prize Competition, Cooperative Agreement, or Startup Pitch Competition). At this time there are not any current Bonus Prizes, but they may be added at any point. Any updates will be posted on the HeroX page. To apply, please register with the American-Made Network online application portal, HeroX, at Energy Program for Innovation Clusters (EPIC) Round 3 | HeroX . Rules and required forms for Full Applications are available on the HeroX website.",

            "description": "Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below. The United States (U.S.) envisions green shipping corridors as maritime routes that showcase zero- and near zero- emission lifecycle fuels and technologies with the ambition to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions across all aspects of the corridor in support of sector-wide decarbonization no later than 2050. Green shipping corridors can spur early and rapid adoption of these fuels and technologies placing the maritime industry on a pathway to full decarbonization. Analysis has shown that achieving long-term decarbonization of the maritime industry to meet the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) objective of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping close to 2050 would require 5% of the international fuel mix be made up of well-to-wake zero- and near zero- emission fuels by 2030. To reach this tipping point, demonstration of not only standalone technologies, but entire shipping networks and systems is needed. The U.S. and the United Kingdom (UK) are publishing simultaneous, but separate Requests for Information (RFIs) to help lay the groundwork for the establishment of green shipping corridors between the two countries.  The purpose of this RFI is to solicit feedback from maritime stakeholders including ports, shippers, cargo owners, fuel producers, marine terminal operators (MTO), trade organizations, industry, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, and other stakeholders on issues related to the establishment of green shipping corridors between the U.S. and the UK. Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to GreenShipping@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on September 29th, 2023. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) attachment to the email, and no more than 10 pages in length, 12 point font, 1 inch margins. Only electronic responses will be accepted. This is solely a request for information and not a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). EERE is not accepting applications. Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below.",

This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is being issued by the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO). Some of the awards made under this FOA will be funded with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). BIL is a once-in-a-generation investment in modernizing and upgrading American infrastructure to enhance U.S. competitiveness, drive the creation of good-paying union jobs, tackle the climate crisis, and ensure strong access to economic, environmental, and other benefits for disadvantaged communities. BIL appropriates more than $62 billion to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)4 to invest in American manufacturing and workers; expand access to energy efficiency and clean energy; deliver reliable, clean, and affordable power to more Americans; and demonstrate and deploy the technologies of tomorrow through clean energy demonstrations. DOE’s BIL investments will support efforts to build a clean and equitable energy economy that achieves a zero-carbon electricity system by 2035, and to put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 20505 to benefit all Americans. This FOA will invest appropriations of $45 million over three years for development of new solar photovoltaics (PV) technologies to improve U.S. domestic manufacturing and competitiveness and secure our domestic energy supply chains. The activities under this FOA are partly funded by BIL section 41007(c)(2)—the Advanced Solar Energy Manufacturing Initiative, which appropriates $20 million to carry out this activity, and was authorized by the Energy Act of 2020. In addition, appropriations from fiscal year 2023 will be used, authorized under Division Z Section 3004(b) of the Energy Act of 2020, (42 U.S.C. 16238(b)). These activities support the broader government-wide approach to strengthening critical domestic manufacturing and supply chains and to maximize the benefits of the clean energy transition as the nation works to curb the climate crisis, empower workers, and advance environmental justice. These BIL sections are focused on: Photovoltaics and Manufacturability of low cost, high quality solar systems This funding opportunity has two topic areas. Topic 1 is focused on demonstration activities that support the domestic silicon PV module supply chain. Topic 2 is focused on RD&D and product development for dual-use PV with the aim of developing these market segments in the United States and increasing deployment.In both Topic Areas, SETO funding aims to retire technical, business, and market risks of solar hardware to validate pathways to commercial success through customer engagement and trials. Successful awardees will be well positioned to attract follow-on private investment, grow their businesses, generate revenue, and create jobs. This will help address SETO’s aims to support U.S. manufacturing across the solar value chain..",

            "description": "Amendment 000001 - DOE is extending the submission deadline for this Request for Information to August 18th, 2023. Please see the full RFI document in the Documents section below. The maritime industry set a goal to transition to net-zero emission fuels by 2050. This transformation requires coordination among all aspects of the shipping supply chain including feedstock supply, alternative fuel production, ship and engine manufacturers, port management, safety implementation, and government regulation. One of the largest and most nuanced discussions around emissions reduction is which alternative fuel(s) to utilize, which have primarily included biofuels (biodiesel, renewable diesel, bio-intermediates/residuals), renewable natural gas (RNG), methanol, hydrogen, and ammonia. Each fuel comes with its own set of regionally-sensitive advantages and disadvantages. This has made selection of future fuels extremely difficult and is one reason why the Mission Innovation: Zero Emission Shipping Mission (ZESM), which the United States co-leads with Norway, Denmark, the Global Maritime Forum, and the Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, was formed. To date, the ZESM created and published our Industry Road Map and Action Plan. The purpose of this RFI is to understand the maritime industry’s current alternative fuels trajectory, the driving forces behind it, and the key barriers to achieving this transition to ensure the current ZESM Industry Road Map and Action Plan still align. ZESM co-lead, the Global Maritime Forum recently released the results of a 2022 survey, titled “The shipping industry’s fuel choices on the path to net zero”, which focused on shippers and a subset of alternative fuels. This RFI intends to supplement this survey and is an attempt to aggregate knowledge from stakeholders to help direct actions regarding future fuels. This is solely a request for information and not a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Responses to this RFI must be submitted electronically to ZESM@ee.doe.gov no later than 5:00pm (ET) on August 18th, 2023. Responses must be provided as attachments to an email. It is recommended that attachments with file sizes exceeding 25MB be compressed (i.e., zipped) to ensure message delivery. Responses must be provided as a Microsoft Word (.docx) attachment to the email, and no more than 10 pages in length, 12 point font, 1 inch margins. Only electronic responses will be accepted.

Specifically, this Lab Call will be a critical element of an effort within DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) with goals to simultaneously spur technology leadership in microelectronics -- a foundational technology for clean energy -- and to stop exponential growth in microelectronics energy use.  Achieving the former goal will accelerate and lower costs of innovation needed to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035; achieving the latter goal will prevent a spike in GHG emissions in the near term and also avoid strain on the electricity grid as the economy evolves rapidly towards microelectronics-dependent net zero technologies in all sectors by 2050. This Lab Call is focused on flattening the slope of microelectronics energy use as part of AMMTO’s broader microelectronics R&D Roadmapping effort now called “Energy Efficiency Scaling for two Decades” (EES2).  The intent of this Lab Call is to support manufacturing and other R&D on prototype devices to advance them to at least technology readiness level (TRL) 6 where they are ready to be matured and commercialized in lab/industry partnerships.",

See FOA DE-FOA-0002910/000001 for details. Reducing Agricultural Carbon Intensity and Protecting Algal Crops (RACIPAC) DE-FOA-0002910 The Bioenergy Technologies Office’s (BETO’s) Renewable Carbon Resources (RCR) program develops science-based strategies and technologies to cost-effectively transform renewable carbon resources such as agricultural waste and algae into high-quality, environmentally sustainable, conversion-ready feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA), through two distinct topic areas – the first focused on climate-smart agricultural practices and the second on algae crop protection – supports BETO’s RCR Program’s strategies for the development of conversion-ready feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts and supports the Biden Administration’s goal to produce sustainable aviation fuels. Climate-smart agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, cover crops, nutrient management, and soil amendments (e.g., biochar applications), are promising approaches to reduce carbon intensity and improve sustainable production of biomass resources. Topic Area 1 projects will assess the efficacy of climate-smart agricultural practices that reduce the carbon intensity (CI) of biomass feedstocks for biofuels. Implementation of climate-smart agricultural practices is essential to produce low CI feedstocks, particularly from agricultural residues to enable sustainable aviation fuel production with lower greenhouse gas emissions. Topic Area 1, Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices for Low Carbon Intensity Feedstocks, has two subtopic areas: ·         Subtopic Area 1a: Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices to Produce Low CI Feedstocks Derived from Agricultural Residues, and ·         Subtopic Area 1b: Biochar Strategies to Increase Soil Carbon Levels and Agronomic Benefits of Crops for Energy Production Cultivating algae (micro-, macro-, and cyanobacteria) and converting it to biofuels and bioproducts is an important component of BETO’s strategy for enabling the production of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). One of the major cost contributors of producing algae is biomass loss due to predation, competition, and pest infestations. Developing effective strategies to protect algal biomass production is essential to meeting BETO’s long-term goals of decarbonizing the transportation and industrial sectors via cost competitive algal-derived biofuels and bioproducts. Topic Area 2 , Algae Crop Protection, focuses on developing crop protection methods and strategies for algae cultivation systems. Questions regarding the FOA must be submitted to FY23BETORACIPACFOA@ee.doe.gov. The eXCHANGE system is currently designed to enforce hard deadlines for Concept Paper and Full Application submissions.

Prohibition Related to Foreign Government-Sponsored Talent Recruitment Programs __________________________________________________________________ The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is issuing, on behalf of the Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office (IEDO), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled “Onsite Energy Technical Assistance Partnerships.” This FOA will invest up to $23 million for the development and operations of the Onsite Energy Technical Assistance Partnerships (TAPs). This FOA supports DOE’s industrial decarbonization strategy by providing technical assistance to help industrial facilities and other large energy users increase the adoption of clean onsite energy technologies. For nearly two decades, DOE has supported a regional network of technical assistance providers, known as the CHP Technical Assistance Partnerships (CHP TAPs). The CHP TAPs promote and assist in transforming the market for CHP, waste heat to power, and district energy technologies throughout the United States. To meet the evolving needs in the industrial sector, EERE is initiating a broader TAP program with the goal of providing similar services for a broader set of technologies that include renewable energy and storage through a new Onsite Energy TAP Program. Awards will fund entities to provide direct technical services to assist end-users and other stakeholders with identifying technology options for achieving clean energy objectives. Technical services can range from initial site screenings to more advanced analysis to support project installations. The Onsite Energy TAPs will also engage with policymakers, utilities, and other key stakeholders to accelerate pathways for integration of onsite energy technologies. Additional activities will include developing public tools and resources, sharing best practices, and building partnerships that drive decarbonization in the U.S. industrial sector. This FOA will make awards in two Topic Areas. Topic Area 1 : Regional Onsite Energy TAPs will fund up to 10 entities to serve as regional Onsite Energy TAPs. Each TAP will represent a multi-state region and serve as the primary technical, market, and policy point of contact for end-users and other state and local stakeholders that engage with the Onsite Energy TAP Program. Topic Area 2 : Onsite Energy Technical Analysis and Support Center (TASC), will fund one (1) national entity to serve in the role of Onsite Energy Technical Analysis and Support Center. The TASC will centrally coordinate technical analysis and programmatic activities of the Onsite Energy TAP Program. The TASC will serve as the liaison between the regional Onsite Energy TAPs, the IEDO Program Manager, and national lab experts supporting this program. EERE eXCHANGE is designed to enforce the deadlines specified in this FOA. The “Apply” and “Submit” buttons will automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. Should applicants experience problems with EERE eXCHANGE, the following information may be helpful. Applicants that experience issues with submission PRIOR to the FOA deadline: In the event that an applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the applicant should contact the EERE eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (EERE-eXCHANGESupport@hq.doe.gov). The EERE eXCHANGE helpdesk and/or the EERE eXCHANGE system administrators will assist applicants in resolving issues. Please see the full FOA in the DOCUMENTS section below. The Teaming Partner List is transferred from Notice of Intent (NOI) DE-FOA-0002944.

            "description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), two Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOAs): 1. DE-FOA-0002910, entitled \"Reducing Carbon Intensity and Protecting Algal Crops (RACIPAC)” and 2. DE-FOA-0002946, entitled “2023 Conversion R&D FOA.\" These FOAs support the Bioenergy Technologies Office’s research and development (R&D) priorities in the areas of (a) Renewable Carbon Resources (RCR) and (b) Conversion. Specifically, the RACIPAC FOA will support high-impact R&D focusing on reducing the carbon intensity of agricultural feedstocks, improving soil carbon levels, and protecting cultivated algal crops from pests. The Conversion R&D FOA will support development of technologies that convert domestic lignocellulosic biomass and waste resources including industrial syngas into affordable biofuels and bioproducts that significantly reduce carbon emissions on a life-cycle basis (minimum of 70% decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions), compared to equivalent petroleum-based products. The R&D activities to be funded under both FOAs support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving innovations that lead to the deployment of clean energy technologies. These FOAs will advance President Biden’s Administration’s goals to “deliver an equitable, clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.“ 1 R&D activities funded from these FOAs provide routes to transform renewable carbon resources such as agricultural residues and algae into high-quality, environmentally sustainable, conversion-ready feedstocks and to develop and deploy the conversion technologies for the production of chemicals and fuels with >70% reduction in GHG emissions. Additionally, these FOAs will support the President’s goal to produce 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) per year and reduce aviation emissions by 20% by 2030, both of which will unlock the potential for a fully zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050. It is anticipated the FOAs may include the following Areas of Interest: 1.  Reducing Agricultural Carbon Intensity and Protecting Algal Crops FOA (RACIPAC): Area of Interest (AOI) 1: Climate-Smart Agricultural Practices for Low Carbon Intensity (CI) Feedstocks Area of Interest 2: Algae Crop Protection 2. 2023 Conversion R&D FOA: Area of Interest 1: Overcoming Barriers to Syngas Conversion Area of Interest 2: Strategic Opportunities for Decarbonization of the Chemicals Industry Through Biocatalysts This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the EERE’s intention to issue these FOAs in the near term. All of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this Notice. Once the FOAs have been released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential Applicants to submit questions. EERE plans to issue the FOAs in or around January 2023 via the EERE eXCHANGE website https://eere-eXCHANGE.energy.gov/. If Applicants wish to receive official notifications and information from EERE regarding these FOAs, they should register in EERE eXCHANGE. When the FOAs are released, applications will be accepted only through EERE eXCHANGE.",

            "description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Office and Geothermal Technologies Office, a joint Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled “Lithium Extraction & Conversion from Geothermal Brines”. Through this FOA, EERE seeks to address gaps in domestic supply chains for lithium batteries for electric vehicles and stationary storage. The U.S. currently has limited production of lithium from domestic sources and also lacks domestic capabilities to refine materials needed to support component manufacturing – including lithium hydroxide needed for lithium battery cathode production. Geothermal brines have proven to be a sustainable resource of critical materials including lithium. Direct lithium extraction from geothermal brines represents an opportunity to produce lithium hydroxide from domestic sources in a safe and environmentally friendly way. The goals of this FOA are to: • Enable environmentally and socially responsible domestic manufacturing of battery-grade (i.e., high purity) lithium hydroxide from geothermal brines; • Diversify the domestic supply of lithium hydroxide; • Validate and demonstrate domestic pilot plants and related technologies to support the transition to U.S. manufacturing; and • Mature nascent technologies, processes, and methods to improve treatment of direct lithium extraction influent and effluent streams. DOE is compiling a “teaming” partner list to facilitate widespread participation in this FOA. This list allows organizations with expertise in the topics to express their interest to potential applicants and to explore potential partnerships. Please see the Teaming List section of the NOI document for more information. This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the EERE’s intention to issue this FOA in the near term.

            "description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Advanced Manufacturing Office, a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled “Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization FOA”. The Biden Administration has laid out a bold agenda to address the climate crisis and build a clean and equitable energy economy that achieves carbon pollution free electricity by 2035, and puts the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050[1] to the benefit of all Americans. The Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO) plays a leading role in decarbonizing and revitalizing the industrial sector. AMO drives the innovation and deployment that can lead to a more resilient, robust, and competitive domestic clean energy manufacturing sector that provides economic opportunities across diverse communities. As part of its industrial efficiency and decarbonization efforts, AMO supports applied research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) targeting the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from high emitting industrial sectors and through cross-sector technologies relevant across multiple industrial sectors. Significant decarbonization of the industrial sector is essential to achieving the overall goal of economy-wide decarbonization by 2050 and creating good paying jobs. The RD&D activities anticipated to be funded under this FOA would support the government-wide approach to the climate crisis by driving the innovation that can lead to industrial decarbonization. Specifically, this anticipated FOA would fund high-impact, applied research and development and prototype or pilot-scale demonstration projects in order to expedite the adoption of transformational industrial technology necessary to reduce energy usage and GHG emissions from high GHG-emitting industrial subsectors. This includes cross-sector industrial decarbonization approaches, via opportunities in energy efficiency; industrial electrification; low carbon fuels, feedstocks and energy sources; and industrial carbon capture and utilization. This anticipated FOA and its associated projects are separate from any forthcoming efforts to be funded under provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including activities related to Industrial Emissions Demonstration Projects.

The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) intends to issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled “Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs” (H2Hubs) in collaboration with the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy’s (EERE) Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO) and the DOE Hydrogen Program, which includes multiple offices engaged in hydrogen related technologies across DOE. OCED anticipates issuing the FOA in the September/October 2022 timeframe, and the FOA will be funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The specific provisions for regional clean hydrogen hubs are set forth in Section 40314 of the BIL, which amends Title VIII EPAct 2005 by adding a new “Section 813 – Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs.” Section 813(a) defines the term “regional clean hydrogen hub” as “a network of clean hydrogen producers, potential clean hydrogen consumers, and connective infrastructure located in close proximity.” Investment in building out the hydrogen (H2) economy is a significant portion of the BIL funding at DOE. The BIL authorizes and appropriates $8.0 billion over the five-year period encompassing fiscal years 2022 through 2026 to support the development of at least four H2Hubs that: Demonstrably aid achievement of the clean hydrogen production standard developed under section 822(a) of Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005); Demonstrate the production, processing, delivery, storage, and end use of clean hydrogen; and Can be developed into a national clean hydrogen network to facilitate a clean hydrogen economy. The FOA will incorporate a range of equity considerations including energy and environmental justice, labor and community engagement, consent-based siting, quality jobs, and inclusive workforce development to support the Biden Administration’s decarbonization goals of a 50-52% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2005 levels by 2030, a carbon-pollution-free power sector by 2035, and a net-zero GHG emissions economy by 2050. The H2Hubs will be a key part of the National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, also required in the BIL, and will be instrumental in meeting national decarbonization goals, including the development and deployment of clean hydrogen technologies. This notice of intent (NOI) is issued so that interested parties are aware of OCED’s intention to issue a FOA in the near term. All of the information contained in this NOI is subject to change.
